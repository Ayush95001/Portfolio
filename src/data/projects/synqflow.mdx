# SynqFlow: Event-Driven Automation Platform

## Overview

SynqFlow is a lightweight automation platform inspired by Zapier that allows users to connect triggers to actions and execute workflows automatically. It is designed around real-world backend patterns such as event streaming, asynchronous workers, and reliable execution.

## What Users Can Do

- **Create Users:** Sign up and manage user accounts.
- **Build Synqs:** Create automations by selecting webhook-based triggers and one or more actions.
- **Chain Actions:** Execute multi-step workflows asynchronously and sequentially.
- **Dynamic Data Passing:** Use template variables like `{user.email}` or `{order.amount}` between steps.
- **Track Executions:** Persist workflow execution metadata for visibility and reliability.

## Why i built this

I built SynqFlow to go beyond typical CRUD applications and understand how real-world automation platforms work internally.

- Learn how event-driven systems are designed.
- Understand message queues and asynchronous processing.
- Explore how platforms like Zapier ensure reliability at scale.
- Design a production-oriented system where actions don’t block each other.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Express.js
- Kafka
- Prisma
- PostgreSQL
- Framer Motion

## After launch & Impact

- Built a complete end-to-end event-driven automation system.
- Gained hands-on experience with Kafka and asynchronous workers.
- Designed a reliable workflow execution engine using the outbox pattern.
- Learned how to model automation platforms for scalability and fault tolerance.
- Improved understanding of backend-heavy system design.

## Future Plans

- Add retry logic and dead-letter queues for failed actions.
- Build a visual drag-and-drop workflow builder.
- Introduce more triggers such as cron jobs and database events.
- Add execution logs and observability dashboards.
- Support team workflows and role-based access control.
