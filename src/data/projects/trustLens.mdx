# TrustLens: AI-Powered Review Intelligence

## Overview

TrustLens is a browser extension that analyzes real customer reviews on e-commerce product pages and generates clear, structured pros and cons in seconds.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of reviews or relying on vague AI summaries, TrustLens helps users understand what actually works, what doesn’t, and whether a product is worth buying. The focus is on decision clarity, not marketing persuasion.

## What Users Can Do

- **Analyze Reviews Instantly:** Generate structured pros and cons directly on product pages.
- **One-Click Insights:** Run analysis with a single click using cached reviews.
- **Automatic Context Detection:** Detects product switches and refreshes insights automatically.
- **Noise-Free Summaries:** Avoid generic or marketing-safe review summaries.
- **Non-Intrusive Experience:** Works seamlessly without breaking page layout or UX.

## Why i built this

I built TrustLens to solve a personal frustration with online shopping decisions.

- Reviews are noisy, repetitive, and time-consuming.
- Important negative signals are buried deep.
- Existing AI summaries are generic and unhelpful.
- Most tools optimize for conversion, not user confidence.

TrustLens was designed to surface clear trade-offs so users can decide faster and with more confidence.

## Tech Stack

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- Express.js
- Redis

## After launch & Impact

- Built a fully functional AI-powered browser extension.
- Learned how to work within real-world platform constraints.
- Designed a read-heavy system optimized with Redis caching.
- Reduced unnecessary AI calls using derived-data caching.
- Improved understanding of UX-driven AI features.
- Shipped a lightweight, production-ready extension.

## Future Plans

- Add intent-based summaries for different buyer profiles.
- Introduce aspect-level scoring (battery, comfort, build quality).
- Implement incremental re-analysis when new reviews appear.
- Extend support to multiple e-commerce platforms.
- Improve caching strategy with dynamic Redis TTLs.
